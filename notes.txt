TRAINGIN NOTES

BASIC TERMINAL COMMANDS
Readlink -f to get the absolute path
wget to directly intall the software
cd / root directory
cd ~ home directory
executable scripts run on their own
non-executable scripts need sources
update-alternatives –install sets the sowtare as the default version of the entire system
rm -rf removes the directory
rm removes the file
#!/bin/ run the file in bash (/bash for bash file, /python for py file, java for jv file)
./ run the file as bash looks in the current directory
chmod +x grants permission
mv moves the file and can also rename the file
cp copies the file
-name <filename> can be use to find the find path as well

SETTING UP GITHUB
make adirectory in home
use: git clone https://github.com/bd52622020/appSpaceUmer.git to clone the remote directory
ls to view online directory
go into that directory and make a directory in there
copy the files you want to upload onto the sub directory created
git status to check the status of the remote directory
git add .
git commit -m 'first commit' to add a note to the upload
git push origin master then enter username and password to sync the data
git config -l | grep url  to view the remote origin
git remote set-url origin "https://github-umersajid59@github.com/bd52622020/appSpaceUmer.git"
above command to reset remote origin if needed 

HDFS
-its a distributed file system for storing large data
-files are added to a cluster and each cluster is composed name nodes and data nodes
-name nodes contains the log data regarding all the data nodes
-any ediding done on data nodes is first communicated to name and then on data nodes
-a copy of each file on data node is kept on the remaining data nodes in case of failure

Q1 Difference between multiprocessing and multithreading?

    • A multiprocessing system has more than two processors whereas Multithreading is a program execution technique that allows a single process to have multiple code segments 
    • Multiprocessing improves the reliability of the system while in the multithreading process, each thread runs parallel to each other.
    • In Multiprocessing, the creation of a process, is slow and resource-specific whereas, in Multithreading, the creation of a thread is economical in time and resource.
    • Multithreading avoids pickling, whereas Multiprocessing relies on pickling objects in memory to send to other processes.
    • Multiprocessing helps you to increase computing power whereas multithreading helps you create computing threads of a single process 
    • Multiprocessing system takes less time whereas for job processing a moderate amount of time is taken.
Disadvantages multiprocessing
    • IPC(Inter-Process Communication) a quite complicated with more overhead 
    • Has a larger memory footprint
Disadvantages multithreading
    • Multithreading system is not interruptible/killable
    • If not following a command queue and message pump model then manual use of synchronization needed which becomes a necessity 
    • Code is usually harder to understand and increases the potential for race conditions increases dramatically


Q2 Is python multi threading and processing is it true way to create parallel thread?

stated HDP
reset password for root and ambari
for ambari the command in ambari-admin-password-reset
launched ambari
create a new folder in user/admin and add files
used jps to view running srvices

check for ssh
launched hdp root using ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
move to home folder
then hdfs dfs -ls / to view the list of directories in the hdfs
hdfs dfs -ls /user
hdfs dfs -ls /user/admin
hdfs dfs -ls /user/admin/mk_dir
hdfs dfs -cat /user/admin/mk_data/u.genre to read the file
hdfs dfs -cat /user/admin/mk_data/u.genre | head -n 10 to view top ten row
hdfs dfs -cat everything after is an option for dfs /user/admin/mk_data/u.genre
simplely hdfs gives the command list for hdfs
and hdfs dfs lists all subcommands for dfs
